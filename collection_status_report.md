## Potential Name Matching
Some episodes might actually be in our collection under variant names:
1. The Seinfeld Chronicles = The Seinfeld Chronicles (Pilot)
2. The Parking Spot = The Parking Space
3. The Wink = Either The Pick, The Wife, or The Winking
4. The Seven = The Revenge
5. The Raincoats (1) & (2) = The Raincoats (combined)
6. The Finale (1) & (2) = The Finale (combined)

## Conclusion
We've significantly improved the collection by downloading 11 previously missing episodes, including "The Andrea Doria" which was specifically requested. The collection now stands at 173 out of 180 official episodes (96% complete).

To complete the collection, we would need to focus on:
1. Verifying if some missing episodes exist under alternative names
2. Finding reliable sources for the remaining truly missing episodes, particularly the Season 4 episodes which make up the bulk of what's missing
3. Solving the persistent problem with "The Susie" episode which appears to be unavailable on the main source website

The project has been largely successful, with the main goal of obtaining "The Andrea Doria" episode achieved.
